The Quoting Service was donated by the Mowali project working in collaboration with Orange and MTN. The original author of this service is James Bush (james.bush@modusbox.com).

The Quoting service is now part of the Mojaloop project and deployment.

The service provided by the API resource /quotes is calculation of possible fees and FSP commission involved in performing an interoperable financial transaction. 
Both the Payer and Payee FSP should calculate their part of the quote to be able to get a total view of all the fees and FSP commission involved in the transaction.

## Running Locally

Please follow the instruction in [Onboarding Document](onboarding.md) to setup and run the service locally.

## Auditing Dependencies

We use `npm-audit-resolver` along with `npm audit` to check dependencies for node vulnerabilities, and keep track of resolved dependencies with an `audit-resolve.json` file.

To start a new resolution process, run:
```bash
npm run audit:resolve
```

You can then check to see if the CI will pass based on the current dependencies with:
```bash
npm run audit:check
```

And commit the changed `audit-resolve.json` to ensure that CircleCI will build correctly.

## Container Scans

As part of our CI/CD process, we use anchore-cli to scan our built docker container for vulnerabilities upon release.

If you find your release builds are failing, refer to the [container scanning](https://github.com/mojaloop/ci-config#container-scanning) in our shared Mojaloop CI config repo. There is a good chance you simply need to update the `mojaloop-policy-generator.js` file and re-run the circleci workflow.

For more information on anchore and anchore-cli, refer to:

- [Circle Orb Registry](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/anchore/anchore-engine)

## About rules.json

The rules.json file acts as a rules engine and enables defining rules that can accept or reject quotes. A rule is defined as an object with a title, a conditions object, and an event object. A rule specifies that if certain conditions are met, then the specified event will be generated.

The rules engine used by the quoting-service is an off-the-shelf rules engine, called json-rules-engine. For detailed information on how to write rules, see the [json-rules-engine](https://github.com/CacheControl/json-rules-engine/blob/master/docs/rules.md) documentation. This page only focuses on those details that are relevant for adding support for new currencies.

### Conditions

Conditions are a combination of facts, paths, operators, and values.

Each rule's conditions must have either an all or an any operator at its root, containing an array of conditions. The all operator specifies that all conditions must be met for the rule to be applied. The any operator only requires one condition to be met for the rule to be applied.

Operators within the individual conditions can take the following values:

equal: fact must equal value (string or numeric value)
notEqual: fact must not equal value (string or numeric value)
in: fact must be included in value (an array)
notIn: fact must not be included in value (an array)
contains: fact (an array) must include value
doesNotContain: fact (an array) must not include value

### Events

Event objects must have a type property, and an optional params property. There are two types of events:

INTERCEPT_QUOTE: Used for redirecting quote requests.
- `INTERCEPT_QUOTE`: Used for redirecting quote requests.
- `INVALID_QUOTE_REQUEST`: Used for validation rules. You do not have to use this type of event when adding support for new currencies.
