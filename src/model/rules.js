  /**
   * The json-rules-engine path only supports selectn paths. This is problematic, as selectn cannot
   * traverse an array with filters, it can only use a static array index. For example, selectn
   * cannot find the age of user with name 'Tutaia' in the following array, without knowing in
   * advance that Tutaia will be the first element of the array:
   *
   *   [ { name: 'Tutaia', age: 25 }, { name: 'Kim', age: 66 } ]
   *
   * In many (most) cases we cannot know the order and content of our data in advance. We therefore
   * provide a more flexible, but still declarative jsonpath dynamic fact. Note that the examples
   * provided below in this comment are reproduced in the tests.
   *
   * Note that the jsonPathFact requires the deepEqual operator to function correctly, as jsonpath
   * returns an array of results.
   *
   * See https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath for more information on jsonpath.
   *
   * The json-path fact exploits the fact params as its API by allowing the user to specify the fact
   * they'd like to retrieve and a jsonpath within that fact.
   *
   * The following example looks at the payload fact, and checks whether the payer fspId, at jsonpath
   * `$.payload.payer.partyIdInfo.fspId` is not `payerfsp`:
   *
   *   {
   *     fact: 'json-path',
   *     params: {
   *       fact: 'payload',
   *       path: '$.payload.payer.partyIdInfo.fspId'
   *     },
   *     operator: 'notDeepEqual',
   *     value: [ 'payerfsp' ]
   *   }
   *
   * Note that the value of .params.fact will be a top-level key in the jsonpath query, and therefore
   * must correspond to the top-level key in .params.path. A general example:
   *
   *   {
   *     fact: 'json-path',
   *     params: {
   *       fact: 'top-level-key',
   *       path: '$.top-level-key'
   *     },
   *     ...
   *   }
   *
   * Supported top-level keys (facts) are:
   * - payload
   * - headers
   * - payer
   * - payee
   *
   * Another slightly more complex example, comparing the value of the fspiop-source header with the
   * payer fspId in the payload:
   *
   *   {
   *     fact: 'json-path',
   *     params: {
   *       fact: 'payload',
   *       path: '$.payload.payer.partyIdInfo.fspId'
   *     },
   *     operator: 'deepEqual',
   *     value: {
   *       fact: 'json-path',
   *       params: {
   *         path: '$.headers[\'fspiop-source\']',
   *         fact: 'headers'
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   *
   * So far, no example rules have _required_ the use of jsonpath. The following rule filters the
   * KYCPayerTier key in the extension list of the quote payload and verifies that it is '1':
   *
   *   {
   *     fact: 'json-path',
   *     params: {
   *       fact: 'payload',
   *       path: '$.payload.extensionList[?(@.key === \'KYCPayerTier\')].value'
   *     },
   *     operator: 'deepEqual',
   *     value: [ '1' ]
   *   }
